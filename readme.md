# MovieNight stream server
[![Build status](https://api.travis-ci.org/zorchenhimer/MovieNight.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/zorchenhimer/MovieNight)

This is a single-instance streaming server with chat.  Originally written to
replace Rabbit as the platform for watching movies with a group of people
online.

## Build requirements
- Go 1.16 or newer
- GNU Make

### Older Go Versions
You can install a newer version of Go alongside your OS's distribution by
following the guide here: [https://golang.org/doc/manage-install](https://golang.org/doc/manage-install)

Once you have that setup add an enviromnent variable named `GO_VERSION` and
set it to the version you installed (eg, `1.16.1`).  The Makefile will now use
the newer version.

### Compile and install
You have to : 
- download `git clone https://github.com/zorchenhimer/MovieNight`, go into the source directory `cd MovieNight`;
- run `go build`

If you want to cross compile instead of running `go build`:
- choose your `TARGET` oneof "android darwin dragonfly freebsd linux nacl netbsd openbsd plan9 solaris windows";
- choose your `ARCH` oneof "386 amd64 amd64p32 arm arm64 ppc64 ppc64le mips mipsle mips64 mips64le mips64p32 mips64p32leppc s390 s390x sparc sparc64";
- build `make TARGET=windows ARCH=386` (On BSD systems use `gmake`);
- and run `./MovieNight`;

Example :
```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/zorchenhimer/MovieNight
$ cd MovieNight
$ (make|gmake) TARGET=windows ARCH=386
$ ./MovieNight
```

### Docker build
MovieNight provides a Dockerfile and a docker-compose file to run MovieNight using Docker.

#### Building the Container
Install Docker, clone the repository and build:

```shell
docker build -t movienight .
```

#### Running the Container
Run the image once it's built:

```shell
# with default settings file (this uses the settings_example.json config file)
docker run -d -p 8089:8089 -p 1935:1935 movienight

# using a custom settings file
docker run -d -p 8089:8089 -p 1935:1935 -v ./settings.json:/data/config/settings.json movienight
```

Explanation:
- **-d** runs the container in the background.
- **-p 8089:8089** maps the MovieNight web interface to port 8089 on the server.
- **-p 1935:1935** maps the RTMP port for OBS to port 1935 (default RTMP port) on the server.
- **-v ./settings.json:/config/settings.json** maps the file *settings.json* into the container. [OPTIONAL]

#### docker-compose
docker-compose will automatically build the image, no need to build it manually.

Install Docker and docker-compose, clone the repository and change into the directory *./docker*. Then run:

```shell
docker-compose up -d
```

This docker-compose file will create a volume called *movienight-config* and automatically add the standard *settings.json* file to it. It also maps port 8089 and 1935 to the same ports of the host.

#### Notes for Running Using docker-compose
The container needs to be restarted to apply any changes you make to *settings.json*.

### FreeNAS-FreeBSD build and run
A [FreeNAS & TrueNAS plugin](https://github.com/zorglube/iocage-plugin-movienight) had been released. You should find MovieNight into the plugin section of you management GUI. However you still can make an manual plugin deployment, documentation [here](https://github.com/freenas/iocage-ix-plugins)
If you prefer to make an Jail without using the plugin management, a script wich setup an Jail and build and run MovieNight into that Jail as been written, you'll find it here [freenas-iocage-movienight](https://github.com/zorglube/freenas-iocage-movienight)  

## Usage
Now you can use OBS to push a stream to the server.  Set the stream URL to

```text
rtmp://your.domain.host/live
```

and enter the stream key.

Now you can view the stream at

```text
http://your.domain.host:8089/
```

There is a video only version at

```text
http://your.domain.host:8089/video
```

and a chat only version at

```text
http://your.domain.host:8089/chat
```

Some configurations values can be provided by three ways environment variables, run args, settings.json file. 

```text
Usage: MovieNight.exe [--addr ADDR] [--rtmp RTMP] [--key KEY] [--admin ADMIN] [--config CONFIG] [--static STATIC] [--emotes EMOTES] [--write-static]

Options:
  --addr ADDR, -l ADDR
        host:port of the HTTP server [env: MN_ADDR]
  --rtmp RTMP, -r RTMP
        host:port of the RTMP server [env: MN_RTMP]
  --key KEY, -k KEY
        Stream key, to protect your stream [env: MN_STREAM_KEY]
  --admin ADMIN, -a ADMIN
        Set admin password. Overrides configuration in settings.json. This will not write the password to settings.json. [env: MN_ADMIN_PASS]
  --config CONFIG, -f CONFIG
        URI of the conf file [env: MN_CONFIG]
  --static STATIC, -s STATIC
        Directory to read static files from by default [env: MN_STATIC]
  --emotes EMOTES, -e EMOTES
        Directory to read emotes. By default it uses the executable directory [env: MN_EMOTES]
  --write-static
        write static files to the static dir
  --help, -h
        display this help and exit
```

## Configuration
MovieNightâ€™s configuration is controlled by `settings.json`:

- `AdminPassword`: users can enter `/auth <value>` into chat to grant themselves
  admin privileges.  This value is automatically regenerated unless
  `RegenAdminPass` is false.
- `Bans`: list of banned users.
- `LetThemLurk`: if false, announces when a user enters and leaves chat.
- `ListenAddress`: the port that MovieNight listens on, formatted as `:8089`.
- `LogFile`: the path of the MovieNight logfile, relative to the executable.
- `LogLevel`: the log level, defaults to `debug`.
- `MaxMessageCount`: the number of messages displayed in the chat window.
- `NewPin`: if true, regenerates `RoomAccessPin` when the server starts.
- `PageTitle`: The base string used in the `<title>` element of the page.  When
  the stream title is set with `/playing`, it is appended; e.g., `Movie Night | The Man Who Killed Hitler and Then the Bigfoot`
- `RegenAdminPass`: if true, regenerates `AdminPassword` when the server starts.
- `RoomAccess`: the access policy of the chat room; this is managed by the
  application and should not be edited manually.
- `RoomAccessPin`: if set, serves as the password required to enter the chatroom.
- `SessionKey`: key used for storing session data (cookies etc.)
- `StreamKey`: the key that OBS will use to connect to MovieNight.
- `StreamStats`: if true, prints statistics for the stream on server shutdown.
- `TitleLength`: the maximum allowed length for the stream title (set with `/playing`).
- `WrappedEmotesOnly`: if true, requires that emote codes be wrapped in colons
  or brackets; e.g., `:PogChamp:`
- `RateLimitChat`: the number of seconds between each message a non-privileged
  user can post in chat.
- `RateLimitNick`: the number of seconds before a user can change their nick again.
- `RakeLimitColor`: the number of seconds before a user can change their color again.
- `RateLimitAuth`: the number of seconds between each allowed auth attempt
- `RateLimitDuplicate`: the numeber of seconds before a user can post a
  duplicate message.
- `NoCache`: if true, set `Cache-Control: no-cache, must-revalidate` in the HTTP
  header, to prevent caching responses.
